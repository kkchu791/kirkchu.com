I warmed up coding questions for meta.

I got basic calculator II and longest non repeating subarray for meta.

Feedback: i should've reviewed and revisited basic calculator II because I didn't know it well enough and I ended up pattern matching during the interview. Tlo got this in his interview, and I knew it was a popular questions, so I should've review it more.

Applied to jobs after the interview.
